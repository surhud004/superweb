            Could AI bring about the greatest good for the greatest number? 
            Does AI pose a threat to individual's rights? Can it protect them? 
            What AI applications are just and fair? Which seems to infringe on these principles?  
            Can AI bring about the best versions of ourselves?  Can its applications lead to human virtues?  
            Can AI serve the common good?
        </p>

        <p>
            Although, AI is becoming the future technology of this era, I am not completely assured by this technology yet. However, if AI can prove to solve some common world problems like 
            conserving energy and improving healthcare then it can be a technology on which someone can depend on. Unfortunately, AI has not been up to the mark yet, in achieving that level of 
            confidence in the industry. That's one of the reasons that we still cannot see a strong application of AI in the market which is put to a regular use in our day-to-day life. Researchers are still trying
            to come up with solutions and better AI algorithms to solve complex problems but it will take at least 5 to 10 years for finding a full-proof AI-based solution to every complex problem and if successful,
            it can bring the greatest good for the greatest number.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although Elon Musk claimed that Tesla will have “full self-driving” capability by the end of 2020, the world is too diverse and unpredictable, for cars to navigate all the things human drivers navigate now. 
            Even John Krafcik, CEO of Waymo (the grown-up company that was Google's self-driving car project), agreed, saying <a href=" https://www.wired.com/story/future-of-transportation-self-driving-cars-reality-check/" target="_blank">last year</a>, “Autonomy always will have some constraints.” 
            If AI and autonomy itself have constraints and are unpredictable, I doubt that AI will be able to help protect individual rights.
        </p>
        <p>
            As I mentioned in the earlier post, AI, if applied in solving generalized problems such as finding alternatives to fuel, reducing environmental impact, improving healthcare and mitigating diseases, such
            applications are just, fair and ethical as well. Using AI to solve immigration issues, replicating human brain, face or emotion recognition or any application involving gender discrimination, these
            applications seem to infringe the principles and are certainly unethical. We can observe from the results of the moral machine that driverless cars are having trouble deciding the path. <a href="http://moralmachine.mit.edu/browse/-1348242683" target="_blank">This</a> moral machine architecture is created by me.
            Recently, IBM had developed a 62-million dollar <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/biomedical/diagnostics/how-ibm-watson-overpromised-and-underdelivered-on-ai-health-care" target="_blank">Watson for oncology</a>, using AI to detect and solve cancer cases but unfortunately, it went terribly wrong in predictions and would not work for most of 
            the cases, a report given by the doctors. Thus, I think that AI might lead to human virtues or may bring the best versions of ourselves, it's all relative. To conclude, I say that
            we are the creators of the technology and it is in our hands how we use it and prevent it from being a threat to our lives.
