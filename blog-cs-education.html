            When should it be introduced?
            Should it be considered a basic requirement for kids in the 21s century?
            Would universal CS education hurt or help our professional values?
            Assuming not, what will we do to pass on our knowledge and skills in the future, and why?
        </p>

        <p>
            In the recent world of technology and advancements, people possessing very little to no knowledge about computers as a broader perspective have been left out at some point of time in their life.
            If we look around us, technology is everywhere. Most of our work is accomplished using a laptop or a desktop computer. From developers and executives to cashiers and customers, we have a wide
            range of users using computers, even from different fields.
        </p>
        <p>
            In my opinion, people should have at least a basic knowledge of using a computer. I wouldn't say that they should know the computational logic and algorithms behind it's working but the basics,
            comprising of parts of a computer, how to use MS-Office i.e. word, powerpoint, excel sheets, how to send an email, how to use internet, virus and anti-virus terminologies, how to secure passwords,
            how to check authenticity of websites (green padlock), etc. These concepts should be introduced at an early age, when our brain is ready to learn and accept new things. From my personal experience,
            I was taught all the computer basics in my 4th grade. We were introduced to MS-Office - word, powerpoint and MS-Paint in 5th grade. We were introduced to programming languages in 8th grade.
            In the 21st century, I think CS education is a necessity and should be considered a basic requirement for kids similar to subjects like Geography and Environmental Education.
        </p>
        <p>
            Universal CS education will always help our professional value because this field is built on top of these basics. However, as a computer science student and a future professional, I would also say that
            this field is much more vast than the basic CS education. Researchers have found that it takes around 10 years of constant practice to become an expert in your field. There are many organizations like
            <a href="https://edu.google.com/?modal_active=none" target="_blank">Google for education</a>, <a href="https://education.fb.com/" target="_blank">Facebook education</a>, 
            <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp</a>, <a href="https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/121.nsf/eng/home" target="_blank">CanCode</a> which are putting their efforts in delivering 
            such education to everyone possible. We need more organizations which can deliver and
            promote CS education to suburbs and rural areas as well. As quoted by Steve Jobs,
